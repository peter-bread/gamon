## Prerequisites

Before you install this software, make sure you have a compatible shell
installed. We currently support `bash` and `zsh`.

|       | MacOS      | Linux      |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Shell | bash / zsh | bash / zsh |

## Dependencies

This software depends on the following software:

### Build Dependencies

| Application | Link                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Go          | [Link to Go](https://golang.org/) |

<!--toc:ignore-->

### Runtime Dependencies

| Application | Link                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| gh          | [Link to gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) |

`gh` is GitHubâ€™s official command line tool. It brings pull requests, issues,
and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working
with `git` and your code.

## Installation

Below are the two simplest ways to install the gamon binary, `gam`.

Check out [manual installation](./docs/manual_installation.md) for more
detailed installation instructions.

<!--toc:ignore-->

### Homebrew

If you're on macOS, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew tap peter-bread/gamon
brew install gamon
```

Homebrew will manage dependencies automatically.

> Not tested yet, but this might work on Linux if you are using Linuxbrew.

<!--toc:ignore-->

### Pre-built Binaries

Ensure you have installed the [runtime dependencies](#runtime-dependencies).

You can use the [installation script](./scripts/install_binary.sh) to
download, extract and install the binary.

This script downloads the pre-built binary, moves it to `~/.gamon/bin`, and
performs other necessary setup tasks.

> Before using this script, please ensure you review and understand the
> operations it performs. This is to ensure that it aligns with your intended
> use and doesn't cause unintended effects.

You will be prompted to add `~/.gamon/bin` to PATH in your `.bashrc` or `zshrc`.

For the latest release:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peter-bread/gamon/main/scripts/install_binary.sh | bash
```

For a specific version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peter-bread/gamon/main/scripts/install_binary.sh | bash -s -- X
```

<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

where `X` is the major version you wish to install.

> **Note:** The versioning scheme used is `X.Y.Z`. When you specify `X` in the
> command above, the script will install the latest release within that
> major version.

See [manual installation](./docs/manual_installation.md) for more installation options.

## Set up

See [this guide](https://github.com/peter-bread/git-ssh-management) for a
setting up the required file structure.

> In future releases, I hope to automate much of the set up process.
>
> [_Or change it entirely..._](https://github.com/peter-bread/gamon/issues/55)

You need to set `GAM_REPO_ROOT_DIR`, the path where all of **your** git
repositories will be stored.

This is illustrated below:

```text
"$GAM_REPO_ROOT_DIR/"
|-- personal/
|   |-- myrepo123/
|-- work/
|   |-- project1/
|   |-- project2/
|
| ...
```

To set `GAM_REPO_ROOT_DIR`, add the following line to
your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file:

```bash
export GAM_REPO_ROOT_DIR="/path/to/repo/root/directory"
```

Replace `"/path/to/repo/root/directory"` with the actual path to your repository
root directory.

Then, to enable automatic account switching based on the repository you're
working with, add the following line to your .zshrc or .bashrc file:

```bash
source <(gam hook)
```

This will run the gam script command every time you start a new shell session,
setting up the necessary environment for automatic account switching.

## Usage

After settimg up `gam` as described in the [set up](#set-up) section, you can
start using it to manage your GitHub accounts.

`gam` uses the `GAM_REPO_ROOT_DIR` environment variable to determine which
GitHub account to use based on the current repository. When you navigate to a
directory within `GAM_REPO_ROOT_DIR` and run a GitHub CLI command, `gam` will
automatically switch to the account associated with that directory.

Remember to source the `gam hook` in each new shell session to enable automatic
account switching:

```bash
source <(gam hook)
```
